# ARK (ARchitecture Kit)

A little tool tailored for my use of Blender mainly focused on archviz (from an Architecture Major background perspective).

I am by no means a developer, just an architecture student who happened to be curious about programming; so if you have any suggestions, tips and tricks feel free to share!

I will try to maintain it as i go, but if a proper dev wants to take over, please do!
